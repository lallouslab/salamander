## Missing Plugins

A few Altap Salamander 4.0 plugins are either not included or cannot be compiled:

- **PictView**: The engine `pvw32cnv.dll` is not open-sourced. Consider switching to [WIC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wic/-wic-about-windows-imaging-codec) or another library.
- **Encrypt**: Incompatible with modern SSD disks and has been deprecated.
- **UnRAR**: Missing [unrar.dll](https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm) (solvable, open source).
- **FTP**: Missing [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) libraries (solvable, open source).
- **WinSCP**: Requires Embarcadero C++ Builder to build.

## Code Style

All source code uses UTF-8-BOM encoding and is formatted with `clang-format`. Refer to the `\tools\normalize.ps1` script for more information.

## Localization

For the supported Translator workflow, generated workspaces, and contribution steps, see `doc/LOCALIZATION.md`.
