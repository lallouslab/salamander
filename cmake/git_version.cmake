# Sally local development version base.
#
# Deliberately NOT a CACHE entry. `set(... CACHE ...)` only applies when the entry does
# not already exist, so once a build directory had been configured, bumping this line did
# nothing there - the stale cached value won and every build was stamped with the previous
# release's version. That is silent and survives rebuilds, so it is only noticed when
# someone reads the About box.
#
# As a normal variable it is re-evaluated on every configure, while an explicit
# -DSALLY_LOCAL_DEV_VERSION=x.y.z on the command line still wins because that defines the
# variable before this file runs.
# Sally local development version base. The SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH is
# src/plugins/shared/spl_vers.h; this derives from it and must not hardcode a version.
#
# Keep spl_vers.h AHEAD of the newest released tag: v1.0.24 is published, so leaving it
# at 1.0.24 would stamp unreleased builds with a version already shipped.
#
# It is deliberately neither a CACHE entry nor merely `if(NOT DEFINED)`-guarded, because
# both let a value cached by an EARLIER configure win, and that has now shipped wrong
# versions twice:
#
#   * `set(... CACHE STRING ...)` is skipped entirely when the entry already exists, so a
#     build directory configured before a bump kept emitting the old version forever.
#   * `if(NOT DEFINED ...)` is satisfied by a stale cache entry just as well as by a real
#     -D, so sibling build trees (the private test suite configures Sally sub-builds of its
#     own) silently kept their old value.
#
# The second one bites harder than it looks, because configure_file below writes into the
# SOURCE tree: every build directory shares one src/git_version.h, so whichever configured
# last decides the version for all of them. Making this line unconditional means they all
# agree, and the shared header stops being a race.
#
# If you genuinely need a different value, pass -DSALLY_VERSION_OVERRIDE=x.y.z. That is a
# distinct name, so it cannot be confused with a leftover cache entry.

    # disagreed about what the build was.
