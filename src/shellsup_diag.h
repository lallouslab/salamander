// Bounded, always-on ledger of Sally's last few shell context-menu interactions.
//
// Why this exists rather than TRACE_I: TRACE_ENABLE lives only in SAL_DEBUG_DEFINES
// (cmake/sal_common.cmake), so in the Release build a reporter runs, every TRACE_* in
// shellsup.cpp expands to __TraceEmptyFunction(). Issues #13/#15/#20 reproduce only on
// machines with particular shell extensions installed, so the facts we need have never
// been observable where they actually happen.
//
// Worse, the facts already exist and are thrown away: IContextMenu::InvokeCommand returns
// an HRESULT at three call sites in shellsup.cpp and all three discard it. That is why the
// 2026-07-03 handoff still lists "the HRESULT from InvokeCommand" as unknown after a full
// rewrite attempt. Recording it costs a local variable.
//
// This ledger is deliberately always on and unconditional: a command-line switch would be
// rejected wholesale by ParseCommandLineParameters() on older builds, and a registry flag
// costs a round trip with a reporter. At 8 records it is a few KB of BSS and five field
// writes per right-click, which is not worth gating.
//
// Contents are surfaced by the Bug Report facility (bugreprt.cpp), which does run in
// Release and already produces a file the user can attach to a GitHub issue.

// Which interface Sally decided owned the chosen command. Misattribution here is a live
// suspect for #13: an extension that allocates ids at or above SHELLMENU_NEW_ID_FIRST is
// routed to ContextSubmenuNew, which in the selection case is not assigned, so the command
// is silently dropped.
