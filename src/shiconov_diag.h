// Bounded, always-on ledger of what happened to every registered shell icon-overlay
// handler during InitShellIconOverlays().
//
// Why this exists: the overlay subsystem drops handlers at roughly twenty distinct
// points, and in a Release build not one of them is observable. Most use TRACE_I/TRACE_E,
// which compile to nothing without TRACE_ENABLE (a Debug-only define); several - including
// the disabled-list gate at shiconov.cpp, which is the single most likely cause of issue
// #90 - log nothing in any build at all.
//
// The Configuration > Icon Overlays page cannot substitute for this. It renders
// ListOfShellIconOverlays, which is populated for every registry key *before and
// independently of* the load attempt, with a checkbox bound only to the disabled list. A
// handler that failed CoCreateInstance, GetOverlayInfo, icon extraction or Add() therefore
// appears in that list checked and enabled. The array that actually decides whether an
// overlay renders, ShellIconOverlays.Overlays, is surfaced nowhere in the UI.
//
// Contents are printed by the Bug Report facility (bugreprt.cpp), which does run in
// Release and produces a file the user can attach to a GitHub issue.

// Every way a registered handler can fail to end up rendering. The comments give the
// shiconov.cpp branch each one corresponds to.
