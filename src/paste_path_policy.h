// Pasting a path that names a FILE must list the file's directory and focus the file -
// not try to list the file itself.
//
// CFilesWindow::ChangeDir() has always done this for ANSI paths
// (files_window_directory_read.cpp: `if (*end == 0 && CutDirectory(shortenedPath, &name))`
// -> ChangePathToDisk(..., name) + CHPPFR_FILENAMEFOCUSED). ClipboardPastePath() routes a
// non-ANSI path to ChangePathToDiskW() instead, which has no such split, so the full file
// path reached the directory-listing code and produced
//   "(267) The directory name is invalid."
// Confirmed from a live dump: ClipboardPastePath -> ChangePathToDiskW -> ShowError.
//
// These are the pure decisions behind that split, kept UI-free and FS-free so the headless
// test can drive them directly. The caller supplies the attributes it already queried.

// Name with StrICmp/strcmp. Same conversion in, same bytes out, so focus matches without
// needing a wide focus channel.

// which is a cosmetic ambiguity rather than an error. Returns "" when conversion fails
// entirely (the panel stores an empty Name in that case too).
