A fast, modern dual-panel file manager for Windows — fork of [Open Salamander](https://github.com/OpenSalamander/salamander) with Unicode, long paths, and ARM64 support.

## About

Sally is an independent fork of [Open Salamander](https://github.com/OpenSalamander/salamander), maintained by [Elias Bachaalany](https://github.com/0xeb). The original Open Salamander authors are not responsible for this project and do not provide support for it. Development is AI-assisted using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). See [Origin](doc/ORIGIN.md) for the full project history.

## What's New

**Unicode & Long Path Support**
- Wide-primary Win32 API wrappers (`W`-suffix) for all file operations
- `CPathBuffer` replaces `char[MAX_PATH]` buffers — supports up to 32,767-character paths
- 100+ unit and integration tests covering long paths, Unicode filenames, and edge cases

**Modern Build System**
- Complete CMake port — all 25+ plugins, trace server, translator, and shell extension
- Native x64, x86, and ARM64 targets; clang-cl cross-compilation support
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with automated releases

**Architecture Improvements**
- `IPrompter` interface decouples UI dialogs from file operation logic
- `IWorkerObserver` enables headless I/O testing without a GUI
- WebView2 markdown viewer replaces the legacy IE WebBrowser control
- Plugin naming standardized: `ieviewer` renamed to `webviewer` to match its WebView2 implementation

**Platform & Compatibility**
- ARM64 native build for Windows on ARM
- Runs under Wine on Linux (`imageres.dll` dependency made optional)
- Consent-based loading of legacy Altap Salamander 4.0 plugins

## Downloads

Pre-built binaries are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/0xeb/sally/releases) page.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the **Desktop development with C++** workload
- [Windows 11 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) (10.0.26100 or newer)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Configure and build (x64 default)
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo

# Populate output directory
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --target populate
```

Output: `build/out/sally/<Config>_<Arch>/`

When you run Sally from `build/out`, rebuild and repopulate that exact configuration first. For example, use `cmake --build build --config Release --target populate` before launching `build/out/sally/Release_x64/` so plugin DLLs and `.slg` language files stay in sync.

### Other Architectures

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cmake --preset msvc` | Native MSVC x64 (default) |
| `cmake --preset msvc-arm64` | Native MSVC ARM64 |
| `cmake --preset x64` | clang-cl x64 cross-compile |
| `cmake --preset arm64` | clang-cl ARM64 cross-compile |

### Running Tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir build -C Debug --output-on-failure
```
